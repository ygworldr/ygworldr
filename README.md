I hold a DPhil in theoretical astrophysics and have worked in applied
mathematical research in Bayesian statistics and game, graph, and optimisation
theories.

I have over two decades of experience in performance critical algorithm
implementation through to high-level application architectures and all the way
down to tiny shell scripts.

I ran the largest email system in Europe and programmed giant underwater
robots.
